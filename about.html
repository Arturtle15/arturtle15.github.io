							<h3 class="hdg">What Is totallynotamazon?</h3>
							<div class="bs-example">
							<h5>When I took my first Javascript course in College of DuPage, we were assigned various projects weekly,
							 which consisted of adding simple functionality to web pages. For my final project, which was my final exam,
							  we were all tasked with coming up with our very website. The website had to include various functions that 
							  would bring our webpage to life. It had to look clean and most importantly, actually work. We learned a lot
							  of online shopping cart, and variable and math functions. So I thought it would be cool to create a very
							  simple shopping site that could work. I went with a mockup of Amazon.com because well I like the site and
							  thought it would be funny to put my own twist into it. I pretty much ended up doing everything from scratch
							   and referenced  many of the parameters and functions we learned to incorporate them into my site. I was
							   pleased with the way it turned out and got an A on the project. 
							   <br>
							   <br>
							   So now this time around I have been tasked with choosing a previous project or any work, and make a good
							   attempt into making it better. I didn't have any art pieces, because I have never taken any art classes. Although
							   I have done graphics design for fun for several years now, but I have never done anything too serious with it. 
							   Anyways since I'm a computer kind of person I decided to go with some computer projects I've done in the past.
							   Now I do have some GUI projects, but they're all within the IDE or mostly console based. So I went with some of
							   the pages I have worked on. I honestly did not have much that were of my own, because most of the projects were
							   edit webpages and add functionality. But I did have at least 2-3 of my own to choose from. The totallynotamazon
							   was one of them. I was able to choose just one site because it had multiple pages. So I hoped to make the
							   shopping website I did in the past and make it better.
							   <br>
							   <br>
							   It was a challenge to work on this site because of the time constraints and other projects I had going on at
							   the same time, but I pressed through because I like doing quality in all things that are important and that
							   I enjoy. I started off from a template this time, because I have never worked with bootstrap, and I thought
							   it would be excellent practice for me, for the next project, which is going to be designing our own online
							   portfolio. And since I'm going to be doing something very similar, having this practice would mean I know
							   exactly where to look and how to work through things faster. I learned a lot and it was quite difficult finding
							   a few things, but again I pressed on I'm pleased with how much I was able to accomplish. I would have done more
							   probably if I had more time, but hey it's my project that doesn't mean I have to stop working on it later in
							   the future. But I probably would rather work on other new projects. Overall I think it's a big difference that
							   is very noticeable and it looks and functions nicely.
